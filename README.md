## Repositiory content__

- src
    - ResultAcquisition: folder with .py files used for results acquisitions
    - ParticleFilter.py: main file for the execution
    - image processing.py: class used for image pre-processing
    - particle.py : object used in particle filter
    - utils.py : class with some drow functions.

- requirements.txt: filed with packages that should be installed for the functionality of the code

### Code Usage 

__Linux - MAC__

- Virtualenv Usage: permits to install not permanentelly all the packages necessaries for the code execution

_First installation_<br/>
(proj repos.) `virtualenv -p python3 venv`

_Activate Virtualenv_ â†’ always before execution<br/>
(proj repos.) `source venv/bin/activate`

_Install requirements pakages_<br/>
(proj repos.) `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Code Execution from<br/>
(src folder) `python3 ParticleFilter.py` main file execution, all the other file will be read from it.

__Windows__

Create environment `py -m venv venv`

Activate environment `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

- Code Execution from<br/>
(src folder) `python3 ParticleFilter.py` main file execution, all the other file will be read from it.
